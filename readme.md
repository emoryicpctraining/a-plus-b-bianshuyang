# Hi!
Welcome to a first test.
This is to ensure you know how to do the questions.
This is a fairly simple task.
## Description
Calculate the sum of two integers, `a` and `b`.

## Input
Two integers `a` and `b` such that $0 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^{40}$.

## Output
Output the sum of `a` and `b`, which should be less than or equal to $10^{50}$.

# Sample Input
1 2
# Sample Output
3
# Hint
Q: Where are the input and the output? <br>
A: Your program shall always read input from stdin (Standard Input) and write output to stdout (Standard Output). For example, you can use 'scanf' in C or 'cin' in C++ to read from stdin, and use 'printf' in C or 'cout' in C++ to write to stdout. <br>
You shall not output any extra data to standard output other than that required by the problem, such as "The answer is..." otherwise you will get a "Wrong Answer". <br>
User programs are not allowed to open and read from/write to files. <br>
In python, it is: `sys.stdin.readline()` to read and `print()` to print.
In C++, you have to use: `cin`, `cout`
In Java, you have to use: `Scanner` and also print to get the output.

# How to submit
Always submit a main file. Either main.cpp; main.java; main.c; or main.py. The test.py is for testing the output.
# Difference with the real ICPC
A real test will: have a time limit to work on; do not tell you the correct answer, not even that if you get wrong answer or not; have a penalty for wrong answer.
However, running a test like this is too hard, requiring servers and good organization.
For the courtesy, you are given a chance to look at all hidden test cases. You will not be likely to be penalized. And you won't have a time limit for solving the problem, although the program has to be terminated within a reasonable time limit.
# How does Github classroom work for me?
The github action will tell if you pass or not.
Here is a demo: <br>

A green check mark shows "succeed" <br>
A red color means failed submission. <br>
